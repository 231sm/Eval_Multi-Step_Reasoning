To find out how many points she would have earned, we need to subtract the number of bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags she had, which gives us 17 - 8 = 9 bags that she did recycle. We then multiply this number by the number of points she earned per bag, which is 5.0. Therefore, the equation to solve the problem is X = (5.0 * (17.0 - 8.0)), where X represents the total number of points Bianca earned. Solving this equation gives us X = 45.0, which means that Bianca would have earned 45.0 points if she had recycled all 17 bags."}
