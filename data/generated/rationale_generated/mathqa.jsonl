To find the length of the second train, we need to calculate the total distance covered by both trains. We can do this by adding the length of the first train (250 metres) to the length of the second train (which we will call x). We can then use the formula d = speed * time, where d is the distance covered, speed is the relative velocity of the two trains (which is the sum of their speeds since they are moving in opposite directions), and time is the time taken for them to cross each other (which is given as 9 seconds). Solving for x, we get x = 250 metres. Therefore, the length of the second train is 250 metres. The answer is c."}

Therefore, the weight of the hollow sphere of radius 0.3 cm is 32 grams, which corresponds to answer choice b."}

To find out what time Ken reached the summit, we need to calculate the time he took to cover the distance between him and Sari, plus the additional 50 meters. We can do this by using the formula: time = distance / relative speed. The relative speed between Ken and Sari is the difference between their speeds, which we can calculate by dividing the distance Sari covered in 2 hours (since she covered 700 meters in 2 hours) by 2.

To solve this, we need to first find out how many people can do the work in 32 days. We can do this by setting up the equation: 1/32 = x, where x is the fraction of work that one person can do in a day. Solving for x, we get x = 1/32.\nNext, we need to find out how many people are needed to complete half of the work. Since twice the number of people are doing the work, we can multiply the original number of people by 2. So, the total number of people needed is 2x.\nTo find out how long it would take for these people to complete half of the work, we can use the equation: time = work / rate. The rate is the fraction of work that one person can do in a day, which we found to be x = 1/32. The work is half of the total work, which is 1/2. So, the equation becomes: time = (1/2) / (2x) = 1/4x.\nSub"}

We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. We need to convert the distance to meters, so we multiply 3 kilometers by 1000 to get 3000 meters. Then, we divide this distance by the speed we just calculated (15 meters per second) to get the time it will take the train to cross the bridge. \nAfter simplifying the equation, we get time = 3600 / 15 = 240 seconds, which is equal to 4 minutes. Therefore, the answer is a."}

Gary's speed on his way to point B was 60 km/h and his speed on his way back was 110 km/h. We can assume that the distance from point A to point B is the same for both trips. Using the formula, we can set up two equations: d1 = s1t1 and d2 = s2t2. Since d1 = d2, we can set s1t1 = s2t2. We also know that the time for the return trip was 5 hours less than the time for the trip to point B, so t2 = t1 - 5. Substituting this into our equation, we get 60t1 = s2(t1 - 5). Solving for t1, we get t1 = 11 hours. To find the distance, we can plug in t1 into either equation and solve for d1 or d2. Using d1 = s1t1, we get d1 = 660 km. Therefore, the distance between point A and point B is 660 km. The answer is c."}

We can do this by multiplying c's share by the ratio of their shares, which is 8/40 or 2/10. This gives us (24*2/10) = Rs. 4.8. Adding this to c's share of Rs. 24, we get a total of Rs. 28.8.

Using the given profit percentages and the cost prices, we can calculate the selling price of each television. Then, we can add the selling prices to get the total selling price. We can set up an equation using this information and solve for x. Once we have x, we can find the cost price of the second television and calculate the difference between the two cost prices. The answer is option c, which represents the calculated difference in cost prices."}

To solve this, we first find the distance covered by each of them after meeting, which is 32x for C and 50y for D, where x and y are their respective speeds. We then use the fact that the distance covered by each of them before meeting is the same as the distance covered by the other after meeting.

The total time taken by D is the sum of this time and the time taken by D to cover the distance after meeting, which is 50 minutes.

To find the number of numbers with a non-zero units digit, we subtract this from the total number of numbers from 1 to 200, which is 200. Thus, the answer is 200 - 57 = 143. Therefore, the correct answer is a."}

We can then express all possible remainders as multiples of y, starting from 16y and increasing by 8y each time until we reach the largest 2-digit remainder of 96y. The sum of these remainders can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is n/2 times the sum of the first and last term, where n is the number of terms. In this case, there are 8 terms, so n = 8 and the sum of the remainders is 8 times the sum of 16y to 96y, which is 8 times the sum of the integers from 2 to 12, inclusive, multiplied by y.
