This is a common sense reasoning task as it requires the ability to understand the consequences of a particular behavior and the steps that need to be taken to address it. The rationale for choosing option B is that procrastination can lead to missed deadlines and incomplete work, so the person would need to take steps such as setting deadlines, breaking down tasks into smaller parts, and avoiding distractions in order to finish on time."}

This lifestyle is often associated with certain cultural or historical contexts, such as the nomadic tribes of Central Asia or the indigenous peoples of North America. Option C, \"living a mobile lifestyle,\" best captures this understanding of what it means to be a nomad.

This is a common sense understanding of the situation, as people who have a desire for adventure or a dislike of routine may prefer to travel frequently rather than staying in one place. Therefore, the rationale for this answer is that it aligns with common sense reasoning about the preferences and behaviors of individuals who do not want to settle in one place."}
{"question": "Where would a person live that isn't in the metro area but still has good schools?", "options": {"A": "woods", "B": "bed", "C": "suburbs", "D": "rural", "E": "neighborhood"}, "answer": "C", "concept": "bungalow", "id": "28aac6d39cdd270d2a6a28e1985484cb", "rationale_example": "The answer choice C is \"A suburban area\".

Policemen are trained to respond to potential emergencies and investigate any suspicious activity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would go to investigate the source of the cry. The other answer choices are less likely or do not make sense in this context. For example, answer choice A suggests that the policemen ignored the cry, which is unlikely given their duty to protect and serve. Answer choice B suggests that they immediately knew the cause of the cry, which is unlikely without further investigation. Answer choice C suggests that they called for backup, which may be a reasonable response in some situations, but is not necessarily the most common sense response in this scenario. Answer choice D suggests that they assumed it was a false alarm, which is also unlikely given the potential seriousness of the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is E, and the rationale is that it is a common sense response for policemen to investigate the source of a cry from a distance."}
{"question": "It takes ambition to complete a job, but the first step is to what?", "options": {"A": "take care of proposals", "B": "begin work", "C": "in charge of project", "D": "eat cake", "E": "go to school"}, "answer": "B", "concept": "ambition", "id": "8c12e5864463cfcd03f4d0ab67949d01", "rationale_example": "The correct answer to the question is option B. The question states that completing a job requires ambition, but the first step towards completing the job is not explicitly mentioned.

To determine the rationale, we need to understand the reasoning behind why \"A\" is the correct answer. The question is asking for a location where someone would not want a fox. The answer \"A\" implies that there is a specific location where having a fox would be undesirable. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine why this location would be undesirable. However, based on common knowledge and assumptions, it is possible that the location \"A\" could be a place where foxes are known to be dangerous or destructive, such as a chicken coop or a residential area with small pets. Therefore, the rationale for this question is that \"A\" represents a location where having a fox would be undesirable due to potential harm or damage caused by the fox."}
{"question": "What type of building has the most top floor?", "options": {"A": "go down", "B": "apartment building", "C": "tall building", "D": "office building", "E": "cabin"}, "answer": "C", "concept": "top floor", "id": "35872be88df5f6c4a6600020266a5458", "rationale_example": "The answer to the question is C, which implies that among the given options, the type of building that has the most top floor is C. The rationale behind this answer could be that the question is asking for the type of building with the most top floor, and option C is the only option that mentions a specific number of floors (100). Therefore, it can be inferred that option C represents a skyscraper or a high-rise building, which typically have more floors than other types of buildings. This is a common sense reasoning task as it requires the ability to use prior knowledge and general understanding of the world to make an inference about the answer."}

This is a common practice across many cultures and is a way to dispose of the body respectfully. Other answer choices such as A (humans ignore other humans after death) or C (humans continue to interact with other humans after death) do not align with common human behavior and cultural norms. Therefore, based on common sense knowledge and cultural practices, answer choice B is the most reasonable option."}

The rationale for selecting answer choice B is that it aligns with our common sense understanding that many machines or devices, such as vending machines or parking meters, require coins to function properly."}
{"question": "A patriotic guy with a camera is looking for a bald eagle, what is he likely to do with the eagle if he finds one?", "options": {"A": "city", "B": "canada", "C": "minnesota", "D": "thermal", "E": "photograph"}, "answer": "E", "concept": "bald eagle", "id": "3a3b5d4a517ef70d25eb558f1a622937", "rationale_example": "The answer option E suggests that the patriotic guy with a camera is likely to take a picture of the bald eagle if he finds one. This is a reasonable inference to make because a patriotic person may want to capture the beauty and majesty of the national bird of the United States. Additionally, the fact that the person has a camera suggests that they are interested in photography and may want to document their encounter with the bald eagle. Therefore, it is likely that the person will take a picture of the eagle if they find one."}

The rationale for choosing answer choice C is that it aligns with the common sense knowledge that community centers and music schools often have musical instruments available for public use. Therefore, answer choice C is the most reasonable and logical option for the given question."}

The correct answer is \"what,\" which implies that the people were staring at something specific. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that they were searching for rocks on the ground and were so focused on this task that they missed the birds flying overhead. This is a common scenario where people can become so engrossed in a task that they miss other things happening around them.

{"question": "John and Judy were parents.  They had two wonderful kids who weren't always well behaved.  They were light tough, though.  They felt it was a parent's job to do what?", "options": {"A": "control children", "B": "guide children", "C": "speak freely", "D": "cry", "E": "understand children"}, "answer": "B", "concept": "parents", "id": "f912bcd7479b76db9b1c57a612b90f00", "rationale_example": "The correct answer is option B. The passage mentions that John and Judy were parents to two kids who weren't always well-behaved, but they were light tough. The passage also states that they felt it was a parent's job to do something, but it doesn't specify what that something is. Option B, \"discipline their children,\" is a logical inference based on the context of the passage. It is common for parents to discipline their children when they misbehave, so it can be assumed that this is what John and Judy believed was their job as parents. Therefore, option B is the most reasonable answer."}

In such a meeting, there may be only one speaker addressing a small group of people in an auditorium. Other answer choices such as a large concert or a political rally would not fit the criteria of having only one person speaking. Similarly, a classroom or a conference would typically have multiple speakers. Therefore, the correct answer is C."}

This question requires understanding of the common sense concept that if someone takes something away from another person, they usually do so to prevent them from using it. In this case, Miss Grady took a stick from Bob because he was playing with it during class and she wanted to make sure that he couldn't get to it. Therefore, she likely put it somewhere out of his reach or in a place where he wouldn't be able to access it easily. Option A, \"on top of a high shelf,\" is the most logical choice as it would be difficult for Bob to reach it. Options B, C, and D are less likely as they do not provide a clear solution for preventing Bob from accessing the stick."}
