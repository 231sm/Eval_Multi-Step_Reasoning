{"premise": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?", "hypothesis": "The question asks how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. To find out, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount she needs. The equation (7.0 - 4.0) represents this subtraction, where 7.0 is the total amount of sugar needed and 4.0 is the amount she has already added. Solving the equation gives us the answer of 3.0, which means she needs to add 3 more cups of sugar. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3.0 cups of sugar.", "gpt-3.5-turbo|NoNeed": "Step 1: Find out how many cups of sugar are needed in total.\n\nThe recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 4 cups.

{"premise": "The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the frog jump?", "hypothesis": "The frog's jump distance can be found by subtracting the starting point from the landing point. In this case, the starting point is 2.0 and the landing point is 13.0. So, the equation to find the distance is (13.0 - 2.0). Solving this equation gives us the answer of 11.0. Therefore, the frog jumped 11.0 units.", "gpt-3.5-turbo|NoNeed": "Step 1: The problem tells us that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\nStep 2: The problem also tells us that the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper.\nStep 3: To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to add 2 inches to the distance the grasshopper jumped. \nStep 4: So, the frog jumped 13 + 2 = 15 inches.\nTherefore, the frog jumped 15 inches.", "answer": "no", "key": "chal-1000", "eval_others": {"accuracy": 0.842}}
