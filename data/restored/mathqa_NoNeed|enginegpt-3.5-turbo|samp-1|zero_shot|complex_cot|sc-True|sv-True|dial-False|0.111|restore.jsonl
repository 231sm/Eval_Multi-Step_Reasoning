Therefore, the total number of hot dogs that can be bought is 8 packs of 250 hot dogs (2000 hot dogs) plus 9 packs of 20 hot dogs (180 hot dogs), which equals 2180 hot dogs. The equation used to calculate this is (211 \u00f7 22.95) x 250 = 2307.39, but since we cannot buy a fraction of a hot dog, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2180.
