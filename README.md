This repository is an offical project for the paper ''[**Towards A Unified View of Answer Calibration for Multi-Step Reasoning**](https://aclanthology.org/2024.nlrse-1.3/)'', accepted by [ACL 2024, Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations Workshop](https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/). 

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

First put your OpenAI API key in a file named ```api_key.txt```.

### Setup

```bash
sh setup.sh
```

### Run LLM generation

```bash
sh generate_answer.sh
```
```./data/generated/*``` contains the cached generation results. 
```./data/restored/*``` contains the cached reformulated generation results and accuracy results.

### Evaluation

```bash
sh eval_scores.sh
```
```./scores/*``` contains the cached evaluation results.
